Hello! Thanks for reviewing my front-end project for Code Louisville October 2020!

I set-out to build a very simple CRM to show off my skills in Angular, and did just that. I hope you enjoy RudeCRM. On load, 250 clients are fetched from randomuser.me's API, that can be edited, or deleted. Also, you can add your own clients. The 'metrics' section which can be selected on the left side-bar, displays overall metrics for client's dispositions.

From the Code Louisville Project Requirements, I did the following tasks:

CSS Features List
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item

Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop

Import Bootstrap from a CDN, then use Bootstrap’s column system to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views (cannot be used on the same page as the Flexbox/CSS Grid requirement above). Note: Bootstrap is an optional Treehouse video
Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 

JavaScript Features List
Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section)

Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation and displays the result on your page

Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents on your page

Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example adding a new row to a table, based on a value passed to the loop

Create at least 3 variables, set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page

Create one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }’s), modify at least one value of that object, and display it on your site
Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction

(I would have done every item on the requirements list, but I just didn't have enough time due to contracting COVID-19 during my time in this class)

Below are instructions for running this project:

# Simplest

This project is hosted on `https://midwiseman.github.io/rude-crm/`

# Simple Install/Run

Ensure NPM and NodeJs is installed: https://nodejs.org/en/

Install Angular by running: npm install -g @angular/cli

Run: `ng serve -o` from the project folder. Subsequently a browser window will automatically open the project once it's done building.

# RudeCrm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2.

Install Angular by running: npm install -g @angular/cli

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
